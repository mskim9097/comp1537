    <p>Prolonged illness which causes the student to miss 10% or more of the labs will require a BCIT-approved medical certificate submitted to the department, substantiating the reason for the absence.</p>
    <p>Unapproved absence of 10% or more of the labs may result in failure or forced withdrawal from this course.</p>
