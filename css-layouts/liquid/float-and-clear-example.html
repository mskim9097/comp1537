      <p>Before looking at the XUI, a quick introduction to the Semantic Web is required. Members of the Internet community and specifically the W3C have been attempting to address the problems with the current Web today.</p>
      <p>While at present, the Web is capable of presenting information; it is becoming less and less capable of maintaining, extracting, searching and categorizing content [1]. This is due to the lack of standards (or any standards) for dealing with metadata.</p>
      <p>HTML does not support metadata other than a few tags at the beginning of a document. There is no standard in dealing with tables, headings, paragraphs, images or what or if they carry any meaning. Furthermore, the problem is compounded by the fact that scripts and references to plug-in technologies can be inserted at any point in the document thus complicating parsing efforts.</p>
      <p>The Semantic Web addresses these issues by offering a framework that allows ontologies to be described so that automated programs such as intelligent agents can perform automated reasoning when dealing with conceptual/semantic search and retrievals and even natural language understanding. The W3C currently specifies an architecture for doing all of this.</p>
      <p> Based on the W3C recommendation, RDF is to use XML as its serialization mechanism although they do show examples of how to do the same using N3 (Notation 3). RDF requires rules about how to specify vocabularies. </p>
